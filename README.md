Weather Fetcher

   This is a simple Python script that fetches the current weather information for a given location.

Getting Started

   To use this script, you will need:

   Python 3.x installed.

   The requests library installed. This is a Python library used for making HTTP requests. You can install it with pip:

         pip install requests

   An API key from OpenWeatherMap. You need to sign up for a free account to get the API key.

Usage

   Replace 'your_api_key' in the script with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

   To run the script, navigate to the directory containing the script in a terminal and then type:

      python weather.py

   Replace weather.py with the name of your script if it's different.

   You will be prompted to enter the name of a city. Type the city name and press enter, and you will see the current weather condition and temperature in Celsius for that city.
